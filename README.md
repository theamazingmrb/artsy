## Technology Used
In this Project I used:
- HTML5
- CSS, SASS
- bootstrap
- Ruby
- Ruby on Rails
- postgresql
- Google

The bulk of the project was handled with Ruby on Rails. Rails was used to generate controllers, and models used throughout the app. Bootstrap as well as SASS and css where used to style the content on the pages.

## Approach taken

I began the project by making my ERD models for Users and Post. Initially I did not include comments, that was added later. Once my ERD and relationships looked good, I made my wireframes. Once the wireframes where completed I began generating models and working with the controller in Rails. After Users where able to sign up for a secure account, and make post, I added in the ability to make comments. Once Comments where fully functional I began styling ARTSY.
